By extending the separating axis theorem (SAT) for triangle-triangle intersections proposed by MÃ¶ller, and incorporating thresholds, the TETI algorithm effectively detects collisions between target and adjacent meshes

**Requirements:**
- Rhino8

**Input:** 
- mesh_a, mesh_b: The meshes to test for collision.
- threshold: The collision detection threshold.

**Output:**
- isAdjacent: Boolean indicating whether the meshes are adjacent.
- time: The time taken for collision detection.
